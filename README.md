Install GUI/CLI-miner dependencies:

node.js is REQUIRED to build. **Make sure to get the same version of node.js as the nw.js version you download contains.** [Download node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

0. ```npm install -g bower```
1. ```bower install```
2. ```npm install -g node-gyp``` will allow us to compile the native module ```serialport```
3. ```npm install``` in this folder
4. ```mkdir externals``` and copy the node (or nodejs on linux) binary into the externals folder

#### Building for Mac

0. [Download nw.js](https://nwjs.io/)
1. Copy this repo to folder ```./nwjs.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw```
2. Copy app.icns, document.icns to ```./nwjs.app/Contents/Resources/```

#### Building for Windows / Linux

0. [Download nw.js](https://nwjs.io/)
1. Checkout this repo into the nw.js directory next to nwjs.exe as a folder named ```package.nw```
2. To change icons, use ResourceHacker to modify nwjs.exe icons

### Building native modules

### Ubuntu Users First Run Permissions Step:

##### To add your user to the device group for non-sudo device access: 
##### the easy way: ```sudo ./linux_grant_serial_permissions.sh``` in the release root, and then logout/login to the linux machine.

##### or the less easier way: 

0. Plug in the USB and run the command with the device ID listed in the error, like:
```ls -la /dev/ttyACM0```
It will output something like:
```crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Jul 18 18:06 /dev/ttyACM0```
Which in our case, the group is ```dialout```
1. To add your username to the dialout group:
```sudo useradd -G dialout $USER``` (OR ON SOME SYSTEMS) ```sudo adduser $USER dialout```
2. Now logout/login to the computer and voila, you can now mine without sudo!
